#Aurora-Optional-Modules
==========================

This is the Optional Modules Repository for Aurora

*NOTE:  As of Version 0.8.1, the Aurora repository format has changed so ensure that you are using the correct format for your repo.
This should not be a problem if you use the latest commits of the Aurora or a release version >= 0.8.1*

# Installation

There are two ways to install these modules, auto-installation, or manual compilation

## Automated
1. Start Aurora.exe or Aurora.Server.exe
2. Type 'compile module <path to the build.am of the module that you want>' into the console and it will install the module for you and tell you how to use or configure it.

## Manual Compilation and installation:
Copy the selected directory to the addon-modules of the main source code directory.
Each module should be in it's own tree and the root of the tree should contain a file named "prebuild.xml".

The prebuild.xml should only contain <Project> and associated child tags. 
The <?xml>, <Prebuild>, <Solution> and <Configuration> tags should not be included since the add-on modules prebuild.xml will be inserted directly into the main prebuild.xml

The module source code will be included in the main Aurora solution when the "runprebuild" script is executed for your system.
